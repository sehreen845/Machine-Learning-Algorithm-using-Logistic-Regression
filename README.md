Logistic Regression Projects
This repository contains two projects where Logistic Regression was applied to analyze and predict outcomes based on key features. The projects focus on binary classification tasks and demonstrate my ability to handle real-world datasets, preprocess data, and build effective predictive models.

Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective:
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on socio-economic and family-related factors.

Dataset:
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Key Features:
Pclass: Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Machine Learning Model:
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification (Survived = 1, Not Survived = 0).
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing data for critical features.
Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed survival rates by passenger class and family size.
Visualized correlations to understand feature importance.
Model Implementation:
Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.
Results:
Successfully developed a model with good accuracy, providing insights into how socio-economic status and family relationships affected survival probabilities.

2. Social Network Ads Prediction
Objective:
Predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and salary.

Dataset:
The Social Network Ads dataset from Kaggle.

Key Features:
Age
Estimated Salary
Machine Learning Model:
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification (Purchased = 1, Not Purchased = 0).
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Scaled features (Age and Salary) to improve model performance.
Handled any missing or inconsistent data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored purchase patterns based on age and salary distributions.
Visualized decision boundaries to understand separability of the data.
Model Implementation:
Trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression model to classify users' purchase behavior.
Results:
Built a model that accurately classifies purchasing behavior, helping identify target demographics for marketing campaigns.
